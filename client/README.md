# Student Management System — Client

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- MongoDB running locally
- API server must be running on http://localhost:5000

## How to Start the API First
```bash
cd api
npm install
npm run seed
npm run dev
```
API runs at `http://localhost:5000`
API Docs at `http://localhost:5000/docs`

## How to Start the Client

### Option 1 — VS Code Live Server (Recommended)
1. Open the `client` folder in VS Code
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Click **"Open with Live Server"**
4. Client opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`

### Option 2 — Using serve
```bash
npm install -g serve
cd client
serve .
```
Then open `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Run Tests
Tests are located in `api/tests/student.test.js`

Make sure both the API and client are running, then:
```bash
cd api
npx testcafe chromium tests/student.test.js
```
Or with Chrome:
```bash
npx testcafe chrome tests/student.test.js
```
